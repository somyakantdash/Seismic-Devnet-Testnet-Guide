# Seismic-Devnet-Testnet-Guide

## Introduction
Seismic is an encrypted blockchain platform that integrates secure hardware to provide encrypted global state, memory access, and data flow. This architecture enables developers to build decentralized applications with enhanced privacy and security, supporting use cases such as exchanges, lending platforms, auctions, stablecoins, and launchpads. By restructuring the blockchain stack around secure enclaves, Seismic offers a foundation for next-generation applications requiring confidentiality and data protection.

## Key Features
- Encrypted Global State: Ensures all transactions and data remain private, enabling secure multi-user interactions for applications like exchanges and lenders.
- Secure Memory Protection: Shields smart contract execution, keeping sensitive operations hidden from external access.
- Controlled Data Flows: Allows developers to adjust privacy versus transparency, supporting compliance-friendly and customizable applications.

## Funding 
Seismic Systems secured $7 million in seed funding in March 2025, led by a16z Crypto, with participation from Polychain Capital, 1kx, NGC Ventures, and dao5. The capital is aimed at accelerating the development of their encrypted blockchain platform, with plans for a mainnet launch by the end of 2025.
